Objects have a 'draw' property, which is called on each frame, with a drawable context as first argument. This context is not the canvas context itself, but a 'proxy' to it. This way, objects can draw themselves within the space they are assigned and the proxy will place the image correctly on the canvas.

To take away the hassle of drawing things to a canvas context, there is a 'drawable' module that makes draw() functions for a few common scenarios:

1. forSprite(Sprite, repeat)
   Makes draw functions given a sprite. repeat can be: "repeat" or true, to repeat in x and y direction; "x" or "y" to repeat in x or y direction only (and scale in the other), respectively; "scale" or false to scale the sprite in both directions.
   
2. forAnimation(Animation)
